# Calculator

This calculator can read an [infix expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) and compute the answer. It does that by converting the infix expression into a [postfix expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) and then uses a stack to evaluate the expression.

## Getting Started
---

To run this program, compile and run the `calculator.exe` file. The source code can be found in `Calculator2.java` and `ExpressionEvaluator.java`.
